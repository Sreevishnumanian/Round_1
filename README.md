# Rotate a String Left by K Positions

## Problem Statement

The task is to rotate a given string `s` left by `k` positions without using any built-in string functions. For example, rotating the string `"abcdef"` by `2` positions results in `"cdefab"`.

## Implementation

This program is implemented in Java and follows these guidelines:

- **No built-in rotation or substring functions** are used.
- A custom modulo function (`myMod`) is implemented to handle cases where `k` is negative or larger than the string length.
- The main logic for rotating the string is handled in the `rotateLeft` method.

### How It Works

1. **Input Handling**: The program accepts a string and an integer from the user, where the string is the one to be rotated, and the integer represents the number of positions to rotate it to the left.
2. **Rotation Logic**: 
   - The string is rotated by calculating the effective rotation using the modulo operation.
   - A new string is built using a `StringBuilder`, which appends characters from the original string based on their new positions after rotation.
3. **Output**: The rotated string is then printed to the console.

### Code Structure

- **Main Class**: Contains the main method and logic for input/output.
- **rotateLeft Method**: Handles the rotation logic.
- **myMod Method**: Custom method to perform modulo operation safely.

## Sample Inputs and Outputs

Here are some examples of how the program works:

### Case 1
- **Input**: 
  - String: `abcdefg`
  - Rotate: `3`
- **Output**: `defgab`
- **Explanation**: The string `"abcdefg"` is rotated left by `3` positions.

### Case 2
- **Input**:
  - String: `a`
  - Rotate: `3`
- **Output**: `a`
- **Explanation**: The string `"a"` is rotated left by `3` positions. Since the string length is `1`, the output remains unchanged.

### Case 3
- **Input**:
  - String: `xyz`
  - Rotate: `3`
- **Output**: `yzx`
- **Explanation**: The string `"xyz"` is rotated left by `3` positions. After rotation, the effective result is equivalent to a left rotation of `0`, yielding `yzx`.

## Usage

To run this program:

1. Ensure you have Java installed on your machine.
2. Compile the program using:
   ```bash
   javac Main.java
   ```
3. Run the program with:
   ```bash
   java Main
   ```
4. Input the string followed by the number of positions to rotate when prompted.
